                Does it work in every browser?
            </h3>	

			<p>
				In principle, it works in every modern up-to-date browser. However, there are some known issues with the implementation of certain HTML5 features.
				That is why we recommend using the most current version of <a href="">Google Chrome</a> or <a href="">Mozilla Firefox</a>.
			</p>
			
			
			<h3>Does it work without an internet connection?</h3>
			<p>Yes. After visiting CMDI Maker for the first time, the app is automatically stored in your browser.<br>
			If you now call the url cmdi-maker.uni-koeln.de, the app opens even without being online.
			</p>
	
			<h3>Why is CMDI Maker not reachable when the internet connection is offline?</h3>
			<p>There are basically two options:<br>
			1. You are not using the same browser on the same computer you used before. The data is stored in the browser itself, 
			and is not available in other browsers on the same computer or on different computers.<br>
			2. Your browser settings do not allow saving application data on your machine or your browser deletes saved data on exit.
			</p>
			
			<h3>All my data is gone! What happened?</h3>
			
			<p>There are basically two options:<br>
			1. You are not using the same browser on the same computer you used before. The data is stored in the browser itself, 
			and is not available in other browsers on the same computer or on different computers.<br>
			2. Your browser settings do not allow saving application data on your machine or your browser deletes saved data on exit.
			<br><br>
			We recommend to additionally backup your data by exporting your project as a CMP file (Hamburger Menu > Export Project to File).
			</p>
			

			<h3>Which profile should I use?</h3>
			
			<p>This depends on the intended archive for your data. Contact the archive and ask which metadata variants it accepts.</p>
			
			<h3>Where can I learn to use CMDI Maker?</h3>
			<p>There is a tutorial on how to create IMDI and CMDI files with IMDI profile.<br>
			There is also a video on that.<br>
			If you want to create CMDI files with ELDP profile, there are some videos on that too.</p>
